If you are using pod CIDR 192.168.0.0/16, skip to the next step. If you are using a different pod CIDR with kubeadm, no changes are required - Calico will automatically detect the CIDR based on the running configuration. For other platforms, make sure you uncomment the CALICO_IPV4POOL_CIDR variable in the manifest and set it to the same value as your chosen pod CIDR.
