It is required to somehow pass/define the following parameters
I did define them in my ~/.bashrc

## Azure specific Vars
export ADMIN_USERNAME_SSH_KEYS_PUB="/path/to/your/ssh-keys/id_rsa.pub"
export SP="sp_id"
export SPPASS="sp_pass"
export WINDOWS_AKS_ADMIN_PASSWORD='windows_profile_pass'
export GENERIC_ADMIN_USERNAME="username_for_all_nodes_types"
export SSH_PRIV_KEY="/path/to/your/ssh-keys/id_rsa"
